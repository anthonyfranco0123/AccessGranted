    <h2>Bus Routes</h2>
    <p>
      We created the Bus Routes page to help individuals create a better bus route system in their city. 
      Currently there are too many low-income, working class individuals who often have to rely on public 
      transportation to get to where they need. Often times many individuals end up walking blocks and blocks 
      after their bus ride to get to work or even just home. As a result we have focused a page on fixing this issue 
      by helping communities plan a better bus route system. We currently are focusing on Boise, Idaho but 
      hope to expand to other locations!

    <h2>Map</h2>
    <p>
      The Map page is designed to help individuals visualize their location and see how the current route compares to the recommended one. 
      With user feedback and user input we will create a requested path in order to help all individuals within the community to get to where 
      they need without having to walk more than they need. At this moment we still have a focus on Boise, Idaho but plan to expand to a variety 
      of locations!
